The issues are as follow:

1. Undefined Types for prices and setPrices: 
    The types for prices and setPrices should be defined to ensure type safety and clarity.

To resolve: It has been defined as { [key: string]: number } for the usestate.

2. Unnecessary Separation of sortedBalances and formattedBalances: 
    Since sortedBalances is not used anywhere else other then to created formattedBalances, which is used for 
    generating rows, there's no need to separate them.

To Resolve: sortedBalnce is no merged with formattedBalances together as formattedBalances.

3. Redundant Calls to getPriority: 
    getPriority is called twice for filtering and sorting the balances

To Resolve: defined a balance with priority calculated and refer to that for priority value.

4. Unnecessary useMemo: 
    Balances and prices seemd to be static and never change during the component's lifecycle

To Reolve: Remove the use of useMemo.
